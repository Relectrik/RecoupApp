Do you struggle with recycling? There are so many different types of waste, and they all have different methods of recycling them. Should you be using the recycle bin or the composter? What if you don't know what to do with it? That's where Recoup comes in! Using an AI integrated search bar to get you the best answers, with an option to find the closest recycling centers based on your location, and even giving you the opportunity to gain points. Recoup is not only good for the environment but it also allows you to reward yourself with a gift card using your points for being a consistent recycler! By using a map API, Recoup allows you to not only search for recycling centers nearby, it even gives you directions if you need them. When you put the item you want to recycle into the search bar, Recoup gives you detailed instructions on how to deal with the waste the right way. You can make an account or use the app as a guest, but keep in mind, you will need an account to keep track of your points. You can also see your profile, how many points you have gained so far, your current location and your recycle history. The point system opens up many opportunities for friendly competition outside of the app too! How about competing against your friends to see who can get the most points in a short amount of time? Or compare how many different recycle centers you have visited? When we think about recycling, fun isn't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind, but Recoup is brining a brand new perspective to have fun while doing good!
